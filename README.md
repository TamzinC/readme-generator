## Description
 I have created a README Generator using node js and the inquirer package from npm. The aim of this app is to make it easier and time-saving to create basic README files for projects.


## Table of Contents
* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [License](#license)
* [Contributing](#contributing)
* [Tests](#tests)
* [Questions](#questions)


## Installation
To run the README generator, have node v18 and npm v8 installed. Before calling node index, make sure to run npm install which will ensure the required dependencies are downloaded locally.


## Usage
1. Run node index.js to start the README Generator
2. Follow the prompts and answer all the questions that are displayed
3. Once complete, you will see a message to confirm that your README file has been created with the information you provided. You should now be able to see the new file in your directory and view it.
4. All good to go!
